# DigitGuesser
Draw a digit and the AI will try to recognise it. Made by Kabir Paolo Singh Bertolani (amnesy) && Luca Bertocchi

Instruction to deploy this project:

         - First, you should run the train.py file, that should create the mnist_model directory containing the model
         - Then, just run main.py and browse to localhost:5000
